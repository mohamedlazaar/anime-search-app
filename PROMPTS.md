# PROMPTS.md

I used AI to help scaffold the project and implement the instant search + abort logic.

## Prompts used

1. "Generate a React + TypeScript Vite project skeleton that uses Redux Toolkit, react-router v6, and implements an instant search to Jikan API with a 250ms debounce and request cancellation using AbortController. Provide code for components, a slice, and README instructions."

- Purpose: scaffold and example code for SearchPage, DetailPage, Redux store and slices, and debouncing + cancellation.

2. "Write a PROMPTS.md template and checklist for the project submission."

- Purpose: produce this PROMPTS.md file.
